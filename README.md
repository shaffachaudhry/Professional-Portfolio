# Challenge-2
Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Information
The goal of this assignment was to create a professional portfolio using the skills learned during the week regarding advanced CSS. The webpage is the foundation of my personal professional portfolio that employers may use to better know me as a candidate for a job. The webpage starts with a header that provides my name along with a navigation bar. The navigation bar contains links that may be clicked on to allow the webpage to scroll to the corresponding area on the webpage. The hero banner includes a photo of myself. The body contains 3 sections, an about me, my works and my contact. The works are clickable links that navigate to the corresponding webpages with the first and largest being the highlight of my works. Lastly, there is a contact section providing the information necessary to contact me via email, phone and GitHub. 

## Additional Description
Much of the code, especially for CSS was completed with the help of in class activities in Module 2 Advanced CSS. I additionally used MDN web Docs to debug and troubleshoot for functionality of css style. The provided README for the challenge include an animation of a sample website. The format of this website was used as a foundation from my website.
